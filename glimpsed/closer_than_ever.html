		<h1>glimpsed closer than ever</h1>
		<p>Why can't everything be that easy? As easy as that night. Everything made sense. We explored like children. No preconceived notions. No denial. Just a sense of adventure. And each other. I've never found another adventurer<br><br>
Been too busy adventuring<br><br>


This world is cold. Why can't we fight that?
<br>
We can
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and we are supposed to<br>
And we <br>
Need to
<br>
<br>
I could feel your soul, I glimpsed your mind<br>
Two unique beautiful souls<br>
Truely lost in each other</p>

<p>you put me under a spell one night<br>
that's when i knew it.<br>
taken to a new place<br>
not by a song, but by a brave voice</p>
