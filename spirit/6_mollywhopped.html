				<p>This molly is catching up with me. Tired but can't sleep. Starving but food is flavorless.</p>
				<p>Glacier. God's stashbox. This is how we are meant to live. Everything is alive and shimmering with this indescribable green vibrancy I started seeing after my first (and apparently particularly intense) psychedelic mushroom trip. The surface of this place seems peaceful. Tranquil. Even now that the molly blues are in full swing, this place cuts through the dark.</p>

				<p>Thought you could outrun that molly? 'This time will be different', 'Not like last time' you thought. You're in debt, pay your bill. Never changes.</p>

				<p>I stood about 15ft. away from a bighorn sheep. This crazy fucker could snap at any moment and crush my skull like papier-mâché. Like a steriod-fueled linebacker with a helmet made of bricks. I realized how vulnerable this depression made me. I also realized how many people this organic steam shovel has seen to be this comfortable with me. They say thy're more afraid of you than you are of it, right?</p>
				<p>But all I could think about was this thing coming unglued and splattering my skull against my car bumper. I wasn't afraid of this beast. I was enthralled. I felt like I looked death in the eye. I was hoping it was going to take me with it. At least then no one would think I took the cowards way out. We stared at each other for seemingly ten minutes, then it sprung with away, vanishing into the forest. I looked at my feet in a reaction to the only trail it left, the shaking of the ground under it's hooves. This was Death, no doubt. But he wasn't there for me.</p>
				<p>I'm not fit to be in these forests, to be among these ancient souls. I will return to Glacier.</p>
