				<p>I wish I could write while I drive. Thoughts are coming to me like they're being fired from a Gatling gun. Rapid fire. Maybe the monotony and repetition of holding one arm on a steering wheel is freeing my mind to think. God I hope the two aren't linked. I feel compelled to write, but so far I haven't wrote anything of substance. Is this writing or just neurotic scribbling?</p>

				<p>I was in a mad race against the quickly falling sun. Find land. Need sleep. That fucking sun is mocking me. It knows how I function without it. But goddamn the music has been stellar.<p>

				<p>I pulled into a few campsites â€” all closed. No vacancy. How can a patch of earth be full? Fuck their dirt. I'll find my own. Or I'll sleep in a ditch.<p>

				<p>Last chance. Closed again. My spirits still surprisingly up. A biker pulls up as a tired cashier offers her help. The biker offers to share a cabin for fifty dollars. The cashier must have seen the defeat in my eyes and felt sorry.<p>

				<p>John the biker was a talker. I couldn't tell you what about. Nothing of substance. So we had that in common.<p>

				<p>I woke up again feeling that all too familiar feeling creeping back. I'm never letting those cinderblocks latch onto my soul again. Gotta keep moving. No time to think, just go. Time again to drive like a bastard on these Montana roads. Great driving in this state. The roads bob and weave enough to stave away boredom, but never enough to make you drop whatever air instrument you were playing. And before I could finish that thought I was driving again. My cars anemic little heart pounding and roaring as ferociously as it knew how.<p>

				<p>I'm too dependent on this god damned phone. Music, directions, bullshit. All bullshit. How am I supposed to trade my weak little car for a Corvette when I can't hear my music in it?<p>

				<p>Thankfully in these mountains my phone has no service. Which means I have no destination. I never started with one, but now I couldn't even pretend.<p>

				<p>Just remember two things and you'll be fine: go west, explore the unknown.</p>
