				<p>I sped like a bastard between Whitefish and Kalispell with a mind red-lining on amphetamines, the RPM needle coiled around the stop. Back and forth back and forth. I lost count of laps and count of how many pills went missing.<p>
				<p>Hopped up on speed I did my best Biker John impression when I found myself at a hotel I couldn't afford next to another traveler in the same predicament. Kevyn was probably a bit of an exagerater, but it didn't matter â€” his stories and lessons and words of psuedo-wisdom still tought me. We both numbed our pain with more vodka than any clear-headed, reasonable person would keep in their liquour cabinet. Decreasingly coherant conversation about the human condition followed though slurred words and half-baked ideas.</p>
