				<h2>1/9</h2>
				<h1>Leaving Fear at Home</h1>
				<p>I don't do drugs. I am drugs.<br />-Salvador Dali</p>
			</header>

				<p>I was somewhere around the interstate when the drugs began to take hold. I was afraid. Afraid until that first ray of sunshine slapped me in the face. I remembered why I was doing this. Why I was traveling half-way across the country by myself.</p>
				<p>I still don't know what was the initial spark that started it all, but something started a fire in me. And this fire needed fuel. I tried to keep the fire alive with all kinds of things: boredom, nostalgia, even the draw of a woman or two. But none of these lasted. They were fast burning flashes of gasoline. Not enough to maintain the fire for more than a moment, but I was desperate to keep that flame inside me from going out. I've lived without it for so long and lost it so many times before, that I was not about to let it's warmth slip through my fingers yet again.</p>
				<p>But when that fire hose of sunlight hit me as I was leaving, I knew I'd have all the fuel for this fire I could ever need.</p>
				<p>This is the story of how that fire went out.</p>

				<p>I didn't have enough drugs to be worthy of a rage through the southwest to Las Vegas, though I wasn't ready for that. Later. Maybe someday. Walk before you run as they say. And the drugs weren't the point anyway. Maybe the point was to channel a hero. Maybe it was a descent into chaos and loneliness. Or possibly something I can't yet see. Didn't matter. The point wasn't even the point.</p>
				<p>I'm sitting in the middle of Montana, overlooking a magnificent landscape and all I can think about is this awe-inspiring planet. And adventure. Fun. The unknown.</p>
				<p>The spirit of adventure and confusion is alive and well!</p>
