				<p>Blinked through the northernmost handle of Idaho. The best part of this state was seeing Washington. Montana should anex it, if only to raise the speed limit. Those thrill seekers know how to drive. 80 on a narrow, twisting, two-lane road didn't phase anyone. Normally the threat of smashing head on into ten thousand pounds of fallen trees would have at least kept me alert. Maybe being mollywhopped helped. I couldn't hold my head up. It pained me to keep a full five fingers on the steering wheel while being a few feet away from oblivion. Thankfully I had taken a couple capsules of 5-HTP (supposedly it helps with seretonin production) or I'd have played chicken with oncoming tankers to liven up the drive.</p>

				<p>I had lost at least a day looking for a place to sleep. Left the hotel I didn't want to be at and headed for some other place I didn't want to go to. Nothing. Nothing to show for after driving for nine hours of driving, hiking, doubling back, and flipping coins.</p>
				<p>I finally found a hostel run by an old man. He was wild about politician Bernie Sanders. $20, 15 minutes of chores in the morning, and some conversation was all it cost here. Finally some calm. After days of white-knuckle and no-knuckle driving and overstimulation from road signs alone, sitting on a couch was hard to adjust to. The air was refreshing out here.</p>
				<p>The hostel owner told me to visit the Ruby Beach a few miles away and see the ocean. I thought I didn't have the energy to sit in that car another mile.</p>

				<p>I was past the halfway point in my journey and had four days to get 2,000 miles back home. 500 miles a day... where was I going to fit in all the things I still had to do? All the personal growth and self-discovery? They we right around the corner, right? I can't return empty handed. What was I even looking for? I just assumed they would be one of the many priceless treasures I'd undoubtedly find.</p>
				<p>Too much daydreaming is a poison of the mind, clearly. I fooled myself into believing I had no expectations, when really it was just missing directions. Part of this stress was this impossibly high bar I set for myself on this trip. Self-discovery. Personal growth. Epiphanies both on and off drugs. Relaxation — ha! — not when ninety percent of my time was driving.</p>
