				<p>10+ hours of driving. The speed lulls me into false sense of happiness [TODO: new word]. There is no comedown from this drug. Well, there is but it's so gentle you just don't notice it.</p>
				<p>I popped a couple to start the drive. Shortly after I began to feel like a normal person. I was going to have all kinds of adventure. But like a paper airplane drifting slowly down, so did my mental state.</p>
				<p>Arriving in Boise I planned on camping, but found no luck. That little voice in my head said to pay for a hotel, but with an empty bank account I would have to dip into my reserves. Fine, looks like we're getting a hotel. Cool place, young crowd, decent bar... let's go socialize, go get a drink. But instead of doing that I drew the blinds, curled into the fetal position, and cursed the universe for cursing me with this malfunctioning brain.</p>
				<p>Oh did that paper airplane float far. Far into a murky pit. Unstoppable thoughts raced through my head. <i>"The world doesn't need you." "No one wants you here." "You have nothing to offer anyone."</i> But it gets better: I knew the 5-HTP would help take the edge off, if I could just get to it. Just 5 feet. That's it. But I couldn't move. Not paralysis or fear, just no desire to. There was a certain comfort to it though. I'd been here before. This was my turf. I was alone in a swamp I've gotten lost in dozens of times before.</p>

				<p>The sleep deprivation and depression had manifested into a half-real hallucination. The dark corners of my room were reaching out to engulf the rest of the room. Smokey black octopus-like appendages reached out from the shadows while I was gripped by lethargy. All I could do was turn to face the window and ride this out 'til morning. You've been here before. It will pass, just grit your teeth and hold on.</p>

				<p>The next morning I didn't shovel junk food into my face, but  instead went to a small caf√©. I got a coffee and for the first time actually enjoyed the swill. These are truly the last days.</p>
