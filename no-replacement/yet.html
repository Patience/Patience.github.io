		<h2>no replacement, yet</h2>
		<p>I wish I knew a stronger word than boring
			<br>Still wouldn't be enough
			<br>Those eyes
			<br>Nothing
			<br>
			<br>There was no light in those eyes, at least
			<br>
			<br>none I could see God knows I tried.
			<br>I know I
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tried
			<br>
			<br>What had i seen in her before?
			<br>nothing
			<br>just like everyone else
			<br>...but one
			<br>
			<br>That's what you get for trying to see someone's soul over an eight dollar hamburger
			<br>Instead of finding one another
			<br>
			<br>I sat in a diner
			<br>being talked at
			<br>a little wiser
			<br>a little older
			<br>
			<br>At least I know what to look for
			<br>
			<br>So few have light in their eyes
			<br>I was lucky enough to share time with someone with wildfire in their eyes
		</p>

		<h2>no replacement, yet (part 2); or, a stranger</h2>
		<p>She opened her heart, exposing a miraculous flame, then put that flame in me.</p>

		<p>A chance encounter with a stranger changed the trajectory of my life. This is the second time something like this happened to me. The first stranger tought me about living. Not rushing towards Death, really. I let that stranger go without telling her the imprint she left. I didn't realize it in the half-hour we shared sitting under a street light.</p>

		<p>The second stranger also changed the trajectory of my life. I can tell already. Bittersweet butterflies come back to my stomach when I see her in my mind's eye. I know our time together is coming to an end. Our destinies will soon send us in different directions. A spirit this exceptional can't stay still for long, certainly not in a wasteland like this. This stranger tought me about a part of me I thought was dead, gone--Not even close. It's still a part of me. Weak--needy even, like a newborn--but it still works. And I was a fool to think this part of me was gone. She effortlessly guided me right to it, pointed and seemingly said "that wasn't hard, was it?"</p>

		<p>I know I don't need this stranger. I don't <i>need</i> anyone. She was always meant to be a temporary teacher, and her leaving will be my final lesson. I'll succeed, undoubtedly, but I can't help but want to share as much with her as time allows. I just want my time with her, as much as she can give. She's already given more than I could have hoped for.</p>

		<p>Our final goodbye will hurt, but I'm not afraid of pain, darkness. It won't hurt too badly. I'm much stronger because of the lessons I've learned from her, because of what she gave me. Maybe 'sting' is a better word. (Should things go south, I've lived so many of my years down there Death greets me by name and lets me carry his weapon from time to time. Most people can't carry it for long. They either get lucky and leave, or mishandle it and take their own lives. I'm largley immune to it. I have no plans to take my own life, but I need to share my journeys with others. Holding that icy sickle is a painful burden that I might use one day, but not until I've accomplished what I'm here for.) I now know how I'm going to finish what I'm here for. The only force in the universe that matters is now the fuel for my inner fire. A fire that doesn't need other people to fuel, doesn't depend on the Earth or dreams or the god damn sun. This fire is self-sustaining and can be found everywhere, if you look with the right kind of eyes.</p>

		<p>She left only hope, a reinvigorated desire for adventure, and a magical kind of fire. No scars, no emptiness, no tears. This stranger left nothing but a lump in my throat and a positively charged soul in her wake.</p>

		<p>She opened her heart, exposing a miraculous flame, then put that flame in my heart. It is my job to pass this flame, like she did. Maybe I'll find another like her some day. Maybe this Stranger and I will cross paths again. Maybe. I truely hope so.</p>
