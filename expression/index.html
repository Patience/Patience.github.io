		<p>America is a nation of cattle.
		<br>
		<br>We are fed the most decadent corn and soybeans. Kept much softer than those in other first world states by our own sloven ignorance. Our culture is consumerism. We are not individuals, but a nation of digits in an ever-bulging ledger. We are a product &mdash; a tool &mdash; for any accountant or bureaucrat smart enough to take advantage of our bottomless greed. We are raised believing that prayer at the altar of the shopping mall will heal. All we want is money, never happiness. The only joys we know orbit our dollars and the mouth-pleasures they afford.</p>

		<p>Our shepherds defend their flock with rifles. We are the treasure the dragon is hoarding. A self-replicating, inflation-less stock of gold coins with Stockholm syndrome who ask for nothing in return but air conditioning.</p>

		<p>Recreational outrage is our national pastime. Nothing is ever good enough. Kept on a hamster wheel of barbarism from our precious light-up rectangles, no one dares question anything. America is the righteous world conscious, and everyone else is such a shame.</p>

		<p>We are a continent of vultures rabid to kill each other if one sullen claw missteps onto our patch of dirt. We'll happily eat our own to see bigger numbers in our bank account.</p>

		<p>America is a nation of cattle.
		Designed to be livestock for a few cowboys.</p>
