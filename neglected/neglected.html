		<h1>neglected</h1>
		<p>I found a part of my soul I had long thought was dead
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you took me right to it
		<br>a dead appendage I had forgotten how to use
		<br>Not dead! Just neglected
		<br>
		<br>I was afraid
		<br>How could I not be?
		<br>I became what I hated
		<br>Run away, coward, like you always do
		<br>
		<br>I ran
		<br>took you with
		<br>took away my last hope too
		<br>
		<br>That malnourished piece of my soul
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still works!
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weak and timid, it was overtaken by fear when I wasn’t looking
		<br>
		<br>Was that love?
		<br>Of course not.
		<br>Trust knows there's nothing complicated here
		<br>i don't Believe in that anyway, remember
		<br>trust me?
		<br>
		<br>But what’s the harm in indulging?
		<br>
		<br>I can feel again</p>
