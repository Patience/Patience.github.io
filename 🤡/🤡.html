		<p>Why bother</p>
		<p>
			No one loves the jester,
			<br>Fast food employees might notice he's gone
			<br>A few strangers phones would light up less
			<br>His desk chair might catch a chill
		</p>
		<p>
			Wake up looking forward to falling asleep<span class="dot">.</span>
			<br>Tell him to take pride in his imaginary job<span class="dot">.</span>
			<br>Show up and stare into the black mirror<span class="dot">.</span>
			<br>Hide inside drugs<span class="dot">.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			He heard a song about loving someone after the boys of summer were gone<span class="dot">.</span>
			<br>Can't imagine having a feeling so strong<span class="dot">.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			He can't talk to women<span class="dot">.</span>
			<br>Cosmic demon keeps his mouth closed
			<br>What he can do is delusion<span class="dot">.</span>
			<br>Imagines different parts of his psyche interacting with different parts of an unknown woman's psyche<span class="dot">.</span>
			<br>manifest in the form of those around him
		</p>
		<p>
			But nothing ever is real
			<br>Just stands there, always alone<span class="dot">.</span>
			<br>Mentally masturbating
		</p>
		<p>
			Back to his cool new prison cell
			<br>Can't wait to find a new one to stare at<span class="dot">.</span>
			<br>So he can repeat it all again<span class="dot">.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			Most days his reflection is his only friend
			<br>The only person he can look in the eyes<span class="dot">.</span>
			<br>Too bad his friend is always scowling,
			<br>Always disappointed
		</p>
		<p>
			Grey prison cell walls becoming suffocating,
			<br>Time to leave,
			<br>Move into the his travel cell.
			<br>This one is ok because he can be alone around all the happy people at the bar<span class="dot">.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			Stuff it down with brown,
			<br>Can't hurt if you can't comprehend it,
			<br>Faux power is so cheap
		</p>
		<p>
			No great quest, no struggle, no initiation into the tribe,
			<br>Just a cell phone to remind you how much better it could be
		</p>
		<p>
			27 years and owns nothing
			<br>Nothing accomplished, nothing to look back on
			<br>Everything he own belongs to some corporations<span class="dot">.</span>
			<br>Made some money for other people
			<br>Headstone will read:
			<br>&emsp;&emsp;Was part of the economy
			<br>What happens when it all goes black and he's laying there trying to think back?
